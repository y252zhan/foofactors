This is a practice package for [STAT 545](http://stat545-ubc.github.io).

This is just the demo Jenny is posting for students to consult / start with for their homework.

Here's how to use the `foofactors` package.


```{r}
#install_github("y252zhan/foofactors")
library(foofactors)
fbind(iris$Species[c(1, 51, 101)], PlantGrowth$group[c(1, 11, 21)])
freq_out(iris$Species)
ffactor(c("C", "D", "B", "A"))
freorder(school <- c("School A", "SChool B", "School C", "School D", "School E", "School F"), N <- c(25,28,12,22,30,25))
```
